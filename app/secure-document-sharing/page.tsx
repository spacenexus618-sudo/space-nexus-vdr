        question: "What is secure document sharing?",
        answer:
            "Secure document sharing is the practice of sharing confidential documents with internal and external parties using a platform with end-to-end encryption, granular permission controls, NDA click-through enforcement, and tamper-evident audit trails. Modern secure document sharing platforms replace email and consumer cloud storage for any workflow involving confidential content — including legal documents, financial reports, board materials, healthcare records, and M&A due diligence.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is secure document sharing different from cloud storage?",
        answer:
            "Secure document sharing platforms are purpose-built for confidential document exchange with external parties. Cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive are designed for internal file storage and collaboration — they lack the NDA enforcement, granular permission controls, dynamic watermarking, and compliance-grade audit trails that secure document sharing requires. The two can complement each other (cloud storage for internal docs, secure sharing for external) but they are not substitutes.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the most secure document sharing methods?",
        answer:
            "The most secure methods combine end-to-end encryption, granular access controls, mandatory NDA enforcement, dynamic watermarking, and tamper-evident audit trails. Purpose-built secure document sharing platforms (like SpaceNexus) provide all of these. Email is the least secure method because once sent, you lose all control. Consumer cloud storage is slightly better but lacks the audit and compliance features that regulated industries require.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is Dropbox or Google Drive secure enough for confidential documents?",
        answer:
            "For internal collaboration, Dropbox and Google Drive are reasonably secure. For sharing confidential documents with external parties (clients, investors, counterparties, regulators), they lack the mandatory NDA enforcement, dynamic per-viewer watermarking, tamper-evident audit trail, and compliance-grade features that serious document sharing requires. Many regulated industries (legal, healthcare, financial services) and D&O insurers explicitly reject cloud-storage-only document sharing for confidential content.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does secure document sharing software cost?",
        answer:
            "Secure document sharing pricing varies by provider. Modern platforms like SpaceNexus use transparent monthly subscription pricing with no per-document or per-user overages. Enterprise VDRs like Datasite and Intralinks use quote-only pricing that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars per deal. Consumer cloud storage is cheaper but lacks the security features for confidential content. When comparing costs, account for security features included, audit trail quality, and compliance certifications.",
    },
    {
        question: "What features should secure document sharing software have?",
        answer:
            "Secure document sharing software must include: (1) end-to-end encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit); (2) SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification; (3) granular permission controls at the document, folder, and page level; (4) NDA click-through enforcement; (5) tamper-evident audit trail logging every action; (6) dynamic per-viewer watermarking; (7) time-bound access and document expiry; (8) secure in-app messaging and threaded discussions; (9) full-text OCR search; (10) MFA and SSO support; and (11) compliance certifications for your industry (HIPAA, FINRA, GDPR, etc.).",

    {
        question: "Is secure document sharing the same as a virtual data room (VDR)?",
        answer:
            "They overlap significantly. A VDR is a type of secure document sharing platform designed for one-time transactions like M&A and fundraising. A general secure document sharing platform can be used for ongoing document exchange (legal, board, HR, healthcare) and one-time transactions alike. Some platforms (like SpaceNexus) combine both capabilities — secure ongoing document sharing plus VDR functionality for transactions — in a single platform.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I share a confidential document securely?",
        answer:
            "Use a dedicated secure document sharing platform — not email, not consumer cloud storage, not a USB drive. Upload the document, configure the recipient's permission (view-only, time-bound, watermarked), require NDA acceptance if external, and send a secure link. The platform will handle encryption, access control, NDA enforcement, and audit logging automatically. SpaceNexus, DocSend (for simple pitch decks), and enterprise VDRs are all options depending on your security and compliance needs.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the most secure way to send a document?",
        answer:
            "The most secure way to send a document is through a purpose-built secure document sharing platform with end-to-end encryption, recipient authentication (MFA or SSO), NDA click-through enforcement, dynamic watermarking, and time-bound access. This is dramatically more secure than email (which has no control after send) or even encrypted email (which still relies on recipient device security). For the most sensitive documents, look for platforms offering client-side encryption where even the platform operator cannot decrypt the file.",

                                Secure document sharing is the practice of sharing confidential documents with internal and external parties using a platform with end-to-end encryption, granular permission controls, NDA click-through enforcement, and tamper-evident audit trails. The category emerged from the security and compliance gaps of email and consumer cloud storage — both of which were designed for general communication, not confidential document exchange.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Modern secure document sharing platforms combine encryption, access control, NDA enforcement, dynamic watermarking, real-time engagement analytics, and compliance-grade audit trails in a single platform. The best tools support legal, financial, healthcare, M&amp;A, board governance, and HR workflows with the security certifications and compliance features each industry requires.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Secure document sharing is distinct from but overlapping with virtual data rooms (VDRs). A VDR is a type of secure document sharing platform designed for one-time transactions. A general secure document sharing platform can be used for both ongoing and transactional document exchange — and modern platforms (like SpaceNexus) combine both capabilities in a single integrated product.
