        question: "What is a due diligence checklist?",
        answer: "A due diligence checklist is a structured list of documents, information, and analyses that a buyer or investor requires to evaluate a target company before completing an acquisition, investment, or other transaction. Due diligence checklists organize the review process into workstreams — typically legal, financial, commercial, human resources, technology/IP, and operations — so that all material risks are identified and documented before closing.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the main categories in a due diligence checklist?",
        answer: "A comprehensive due diligence checklist covers six main categories: (1) Legal — corporate structure, contracts, litigation, and regulatory compliance; (2) Financial — audited statements, tax records, working capital, and debt; (3) Commercial — customers, market position, competitive landscape, and pipeline; (4) Human Resources — key employees, compensation, equity plans, and retention risk; (5) Technology & IP — source code, patents, cybersecurity, and data privacy; (6) Operations — facilities, suppliers, insurance, and environmental compliance.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does due diligence take?",
        answer: "Due diligence for a mid-market M&A transaction typically takes 4–8 weeks from the time a data room is opened. Large-cap or complex transactions can run 8–16 weeks. Startup fundraising due diligence (Series A–C) is typically 2–4 weeks. The timeline depends on: how organized the seller's data room is, the complexity and size of the business, the number of workstreams running in parallel, and whether unexpected issues require deeper investigation.",
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between buy-side and sell-side due diligence?",
        answer: "Buy-side due diligence is conducted by the acquirer (or investor) to evaluate the target before deciding to proceed and on what terms. Sell-side due diligence (also called vendor due diligence) is commissioned by the seller ahead of a process to proactively prepare documentation, identify and resolve issues before they appear during buyer review, and accelerate the timeline by having an organized data room ready at launch.",
    },
    {
        question: "What documents should go in a due diligence data room?",
        answer: "A due diligence data room should contain: audited financial statements (3 years), management accounts, the cap table, corporate formation documents and board minutes, material contracts, employment agreements, IP ownership documentation, technology architecture overview, cybersecurity certifications, tax returns, insurance policies, regulatory filings, and an org chart. Organizing these documents in a purpose-built virtual data room (VDR) — rather than a shared drive — provides the granular access controls, NDA enforcement, audit trail, and Q&A workflow that a proper due diligence process requires.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the biggest risks found during due diligence?",
        answer: "The most common deal-breaking issues discovered during due diligence are: (1) Revenue quality problems — revenue is more concentrated, less recurring, or lower-margin than presented; (2) IP ownership gaps — founders or early contractors didn't sign IP assignment agreements; (3) Undisclosed liabilities — contingent legal claims, tax positions, or off-balance-sheet obligations; (4) Key person risk — a single executive holds disproportionate customer relationships or technical knowledge; (5) Contract change-of-control provisions that give major customers or lenders termination rights on the acquisition; (6) Data privacy non-compliance (GDPR, CCPA) creating regulatory exposure.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need a virtual data room for due diligence?",
        answer: "Yes, for any transaction involving confidential financial, legal, or personnel documents, a virtual data room (VDR) is the appropriate tool. VDRs provide: mandatory NDA click-through at room entry, document-level and page-level access permissions (so advisors see documents their counterparts cannot), a tamper-evident audit trail required for legal defensibility, structured Q&A workflow to manage due diligence questions, dynamic watermarking to deter unauthorized sharing, and compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) required by financial regulators. Using Dropbox, Google Drive, or SharePoint for M&A due diligence creates legal, compliance, and security exposure.",

                                <strong className="text-gray-900">Due diligence</strong> is the structured process of investigating a business, asset, or investment before completing a transaction. In an M&A context, due diligence is the period between signing a letter of intent (LOI) and signing a definitive purchase agreement — during which the buyer's advisors independently verify the seller's representations about the business.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A due diligence checklist organizes this investigation into workstreams, ensuring no material area is overlooked. Due diligence is not a bureaucratic exercise — it is the mechanism by which acquirers and investors validate their investment thesis, discover deal-breakers, and establish the factual basis for purchase price adjustments and indemnity provisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scope of any due diligence checklist will vary by deal type, industry, and transaction size. The checklist below covers the standard workstreams for a mid-market M&A transaction. Deal teams should expand or contract scope based on materiality and deal-specific risks.
