const faqItems = [
    {
        question: "What is data room software?",
        answer: "Data room software is a secure, cloud-based platform purpose-built for storing and sharing confidential documents during business transactions. Unlike general file-sharing tools, data room software provides the security controls, compliance certifications, and transaction-specific workflow features — NDA enforcement, granular permissions, tamper-evident audit trails, structured Q&A, and buyer analytics — required for M&A due diligence, fundraising, legal proceedings, and other high-stakes document exchanges.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is data room software different from SharePoint or Google Drive?",
        answer: "SharePoint and Google Drive are enterprise productivity tools not designed for transactional document security. Data room software differs in three critical ways: (1) Compliance — data room software holds SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and regulatory certifications that generic tools do not; (2) Transaction controls — NDA click-through enforcement, dynamic watermarking, document expiry, and remote wipe are data room-specific features; (3) Deal workflow — structured Q&A with audit trails, buyer engagement analytics, and privilege wall management are absent from productivity tools. Using SharePoint or Google Drive for M&A due diligence creates legal and compliance exposure.",
    },
    {
        question: "What features should data room software have?",
        answer: "Essential features for data room software include: SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification; AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit; NDA click-through enforcement; granular permissions at the folder, document, and page level; dynamic watermarking; a tamper-evident immutable audit trail; structured Q&A workflow management; full-text search across 100+ file types; bulk upload with AI auto-indexing; real-time buyer engagement analytics; and transparent pricing without per-page charges. Modern platforms like SpaceNexus also include AI document redaction and auto-categorization as standard features.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does data room software cost?",
        answer: "Data room software pricing varies significantly by provider. SpaceNexus offers transparent, published pricing with no per-page fees — AI redaction, buyer analytics, and Q&A workflow are all included. Legacy enterprise platforms like Datasite and Intralinks operate on quote-only pricing that typically ranges in the tens of thousands per deal, with additional charges for AI features and user licenses. When comparing costs, account for per-page upload fees, user caps, storage overages, and add-on charges that inflate legacy platform bills mid-deal.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can data room software integrate with other tools?",
        answer: "Most modern data room software supports integrations with enterprise tools. SpaceNexus integrates with DocuSign for e-signatures, Salesforce for CRM deal tracking, Microsoft 365 for document collaboration, and Slack for deal team notifications. Key integrations to look for include e-signature platforms (DocuSign, Adobe Sign), CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot), identity providers (Okta, Azure AD) for SSO, and cloud storage platforms for document import.",
    },
    {
        question: "How quickly can data room software be set up?",
        answer: "Modern data room software like SpaceNexus can be fully configured and live in under 24 hours — without any onboarding calls or dedicated implementation support. Upload documents via bulk drag-and-drop, configure permission groups, set the NDA, and send invitations to buyers or counsel within hours. Legacy platforms like Datasite and Intralinks require multiple days and dedicated customer success manager involvement for initial setup, which can delay deal timelines.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is data room software secure enough for M&A transactions?",
        answer: "Purpose-built data room software meets the security standards required for M&A transactions. SpaceNexus holds SOC 2 Type II certification, aligns with ISO 27001, and is SEC/FINRA ready for US investment banking transactions. The platform uses AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, Zero Trust architecture, and multi-factor authentication. Every document access event is logged in an immutable audit trail. Generic file-sharing tools do not meet these requirements and should not be used for confidential deal materials.",

                                Data room software is a secure, cloud-hosted platform for storing, organizing, and sharing confidential documents during business transactions. The category was designed to replace physical data rooms — supervised facilities where deal parties reviewed printed documents — with a digital equivalent that provides the same security controls at a fraction of the cost and with far greater efficiency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The defining feature of purpose-built data room software is its transaction-specific compliance layer: NDA enforcement at room entry, document-level access controls, an immutable audit trail logging every view and download, structured Q&A workflow management, and security certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) required by financial regulators and legal counterparties. These features are absent from general productivity tools like SharePoint, Dropbox, or Google Drive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2026, the data room software market splits clearly into two tiers: legacy enterprise platforms (Datasite, Intralinks) built in the 1990s that charge tens of thousands per deal with opaque quote-based pricing, and a newer generation of AI-powered platforms like SpaceNexus that deliver the same security and compliance with AI redaction, auto-categorization, and buyer analytics included at a transparent, published monthly price.
