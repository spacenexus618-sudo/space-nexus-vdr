    title: "What is a Virtual Data Room?",
    content: `A virtual data room (VDR) is a secure online repository used to store, share, and manage confidential documents during sensitive business transactions. Think of it as a digital version of the physical data rooms that were traditionally used in M&A deals — but with far greater security, accessibility, and control.

Virtual data rooms enable multiple parties — buyers, sellers, lawyers, accountants, and advisors — to review confidential documents in a controlled environment without physically meeting. Every action is logged, every access is tracked, and every document is protected.`,
  },
  {
    id: "how-vdrs-work",
    title: "How Do Virtual Data Rooms Work?",
    content: `Virtual data rooms operate on a simple but powerful model: centralized document storage with granular access control. Here's how the process typically works:

1. **Setup**: The deal team creates a data room, configures folder structure, and sets up permission groups.
2. **Document Upload**: Confidential documents are uploaded — financial statements, contracts, IP filings, employee records, and more.
3. **Access Control**: Administrators invite bidders, advisors, and other parties with specific permission levels (view-only, download, print, etc.).
4. **Collaboration**: Authorized users review documents, ask questions through structured Q&A workflows, and provide feedback.
5. **Audit Trail**: Every action — who viewed what, when, and for how long — is logged in an immutable audit trail.
6. **Deal Close**: Once the transaction completes, access is revoked and documents are archived.`,
  },
  {
    id: "key-features",
    title: "Key Features of Modern Virtual Data Rooms",
    content: `Modern virtual data rooms offer a comprehensive suite of features designed to streamline transactions while maintaining security:

**Security Features:**
- AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access controls with document-level permissions
- Dynamic watermarking (displays viewer name, IP, timestamp)
- Document expiry and remote shredding
- IP whitelisting and device restrictions
- Two-factor authentication and SSO/SAML

**Collaboration Features:**
- Structured Q&A workflows with category routing
- Real-time document collaboration
- Comment and annotation tools
- Bulk document upload with auto-indexing
- Full-text search across all documents

**Analytics & Intelligence:**
- Per-user engagement tracking (who viewed what, for how long)
- Document heatmaps showing interest levels
- Bidder activity scoring
- Exportable audit logs for compliance`,

  {
    id: "vdr-vs-cloud",
    title: "Virtual Data Room vs Cloud Storage",
    content: `Many people confuse virtual data rooms with cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive. While both store files online, they serve fundamentally different purposes:

| Feature | Virtual Data Room | Cloud Storage |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Secure transaction management | General file sharing |
| Access Control | Granular, document-level | Basic folder-level |
| Audit Trail | Immutable, detailed | Limited or none |
| Watermarking | Dynamic, per-viewer | Not available |
| Q&A Workflow | Structured, categorized | Not available |
| Compliance | SOC 2, ISO 27001 | Basic security |
| Pricing | $100-150,000+/year | Free-$20/month |

If you're sharing confidential documents for a business transaction — M&A deal, fundraising round, legal proceeding, or audit — you need a virtual data room, not cloud storage.`,
  },
  {
    id: "use-cases",
    title: "Common Use Cases for Virtual Data Rooms",
    content: `Virtual data rooms are essential across many business scenarios:

**M&A Due Diligence** — The most common use case. Sellers create VDRs to share confidential documents with potential buyers during the due diligence process. AI-powered VDRs can auto-categorize thousands of documents in minutes.

**Capital Raising** — Startups and growth companies use VDRs to share financial projections, cap tables, and business plans with potential investors during fundraising rounds.

**IPO Preparation** — Companies preparing for public offerings use VDRs to organize SEC filings, financial statements, and governance documents for underwriters and regulators.

**Legal Proceedings** — Law firms use VDRs for litigation discovery, sharing evidence and case documents with opposing counsel under strict access controls.

**Private Equity** — PE firms use VDRs for buy-side due diligence, portfolio company reporting, and LP fundraising document management.

**Board Portals** — Companies use VDRs to share board meeting materials, strategic plans, and sensitive corporate documents with board members.`,

    id: "how-to-choose",
    title: "How to Choose a Virtual Data Room",
    content: `Selecting the right virtual data room depends on your specific needs. Here's a practical evaluation framework:

**Step 1: Define Your Requirements**
- What type of transaction? (M&A, fundraising, legal, compliance)
- How many users will need access?
- What's your document volume?
- What compliance standards must you meet?

**Step 2: Evaluate Security**
- Is the provider SOC 2 Type II certified?
- Do they offer AES-256 encryption?
- Can you set document-level permissions?
- Is there dynamic watermarking?
- Are audit logs immutable?

**Step 3: Assess Usability**
- Can you set up the room without onboarding calls?
- Is the interface intuitive for external users?
- Does it support bulk upload and auto-indexing?
- Is there a mobile experience?

**Step 4: Compare Pricing**
- Is pricing transparent or quote-only?
- Are there per-page or per-user fees?
- What's included in each tier?
- Is there a free trial?

**Step 5: Check Support**
- Is support available 24/7?
- Do they offer dedicated account management?
- What's the average response time?`,

  {
    id: "pricing",
    title: "Virtual Data Room Pricing Guide",
    content: `VDR pricing varies dramatically based on provider, features, and deal size:

**Budget Tier ($100-500/month)**
Basic VDRs for small deals and simple document sharing. Suitable for sub-$5M transactions with limited users.

**Mid-Market Tier ($500-2,000/month)**
Full-featured VDRs with Q&A workflows, analytics, and compliance. Suitable for $5-50M deals with multiple bidders.

**Enterprise Tier ($15,000-150,000+/year)**
Premium VDRs like Datasite and Intralinks with white-glove service, advanced analytics, and global compliance. Suitable for $50M+ transactions.

**Key Pricing Factors:**
