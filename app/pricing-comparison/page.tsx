SpaceNexus includes all of these in the base price.",

        answer:
            "Per-page fees are common at legacy enterprise VDRs (Datasite, Intralinks) and can be a material cost driver. A mid-sized M&A deal with 5,000 pages can generate tens of thousands of dollars in page-fee events.

        question: "What is the most expensive VDR?",

Total cost for a single mid-market M&A deal can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Mid-market platforms (Firmex, iDeals, SpaceNexus) offer transparent pricing at a fraction of the enterprise cost.",

        question: "What is the cheapest VDR?",
        answer:
            "The cheapest VDR options are consumer cloud storage platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox) and entry-level services (DocSend for pitch decks). However, these platforms lack the security features, compliance certifications, and transaction-specific workflows required for M&A and institutional fundraising. The best value for mid-market transactions is a transparent flat-rate platform like SpaceNexus that includes AI features, unlimited users, and no per-page fees.",

Transparent flat-rate monthly pricing with no per-page fees, no setup fees, and no AI add-ons delivers the same security and AI capabilities at a fraction of the total cost.

            "For a typical Series A round with 2,000 pages and 25 users over 6 weeks, the cost varies dramatically by provider. Legacy enterprise VDRs charge quote-only pricing that can run into the tens of thousands. Mid-market platforms charge per-project fees that are typically a fraction of enterprise cost. SpaceNexus uses transparent flat-rate monthly pricing that is published publicly and includes all AI features with no per-page fees.",

        question: "Why are legacy VDRs so expensive?",
        answer:
            "Legacy VDRs are expensive because of their enterprise cost structure: large customer success teams, complex implementations, per-page fees, AI add-ons, and annual contract minimums. These costs make sense for bulge-bracket M&A where deal values justify the spend, but they are disproportionate for mid-market M&A, fundraising, and routine transactions. Modern AI-powered platforms like SpaceNexus deliver the same security at a fraction of the cost by automating setup, eliminating per-page fees, and including AI in the base price.",

                                    <strong>SpaceNexus is the only major VDR provider that publishes transparent flat-rate monthly pricing</strong> — with no per-page fees, no setup fees, no AI add-ons, and no annual lock-in. Every plan includes AI redaction, auto-categorization, engagement analytics, and SOC 2 Type II security.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Legacy enterprise VDRs (Datasite, Intralinks) use quote-only contracts</strong> that can include per-page fees, AI add-ons, setup charges, and annual commitments. For most mid-market M&A and fundraising, these contracts cost significantly more than SpaceNexus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Mid-market platforms (Firmex, iDeals) use per-project pricing</strong> that is more transparent than legacy VDRs but does not include AI features. They work for predictable M&A workflows but lack the modern AI automation that SpaceNexus provides.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>The cheapest options (DocSend, Google Drive, email)</strong> are affordable but lack the security features, compliance certifications, and transaction-specific workflows required for M&A and institutional fundraising. They work for pre-seed pitch decks and internal collaboration — but not for transactions.
