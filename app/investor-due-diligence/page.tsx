    {
        question: "What is fundraising and investor due diligence?",
        answer:
            "Fundraising is the process by which startups raise capital from investors — typically through priced equity rounds (pre-seed, seed, Series A, B, C+) or convertible instruments (SAFEs, notes). Investor due diligence is the process investors run before investing to verify the company's claims about product, market, team, financials, and legal status. Diligence typically involves a full data room review, customer reference calls, expert interviews, and sometimes third-party financial or technical audits. The process can take 4–8 weeks for priced rounds.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does fundraising take?",
        answer:
            "Fundraising timelines vary by stage. Pre-seed rounds typically take 3–6 weeks from first conversation to close. Seed rounds take 3–6 months. Series A rounds take 4–8 months including diligence. Series B and beyond typically take 4–8 months but with much deeper institutional diligence. Plan for fundraising to consume 30–50% of a founder's time during the process.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between fundraising and investor due diligence?",
        answer:
            "Fundraising is the overall process of raising capital — pitching investors, getting term sheets, negotiating, and closing. Investor due diligence is one specific phase within fundraising where investors verify the company's claims by reviewing the data room, conducting reference calls, and running financial or technical analyses. Diligence happens after the term sheet and before closing.",
    },
    {
        question: "What documents do investors need for due diligence?",
        answer:
            "Investor due diligence typically requires: (1) Corporate — cap table, incorporation documents, board minutes, IP assignments; (2) Financial — historical financials, current KPIs, projections, unit economics; (3) Commercial — customer references, pipeline, churn analysis; (4) HR — org chart, employment agreements, equity plan; (5) Technology — architecture overview, security reports, SOC 2 audit; (6) Tax/Regulatory — tax returns, regulatory filings, material contracts. A complete pre-built data room dramatically accelerates the diligence process.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I prepare for investor due diligence?",
        answer:
            "The best preparation is to set up a comprehensive data room 4–6 weeks before you start fundraising. Organize by workstream (Corporate, Financial, Commercial, HR, Technology, Tax/Regulatory). Pre-populate every document an investor might request. Run a mock diligence with a fractional CFO or experienced advisor. Have your cap table clean and audit-ready. Use a modern data room platform with AI auto-categorization and real-time engagement tracking.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is a data room for fundraising?",
        answer:
            "A fundraising data room is a secure, cloud-based platform where startups organize and share confidential documents with prospective and current investors. Modern data rooms for fundraising include: (1) AI auto-categorization that organizes documents by workstream; (2) per-investor NDA click-through enforcement; (3) per-investor permission groups; (4) real-time engagement analytics showing which investors have reviewed which documents; (5) structured Q&A workflow for investor questions; and (6) SOC 2 Type II security. Top platforms include SpaceNexus, DocSend, and Carta Data Rooms.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does investor due diligence take?",
        answer:
            "Investor due diligence typically takes 4–8 weeks for a priced equity round. The process includes data room review, customer reference calls, expert interviews, financial analysis, and legal review. For larger rounds (Series B+), third-party technical or financial audits can add 2–4 weeks. Pre-built, well-organized data rooms dramatically compress this timeline — some rounds close in 6 weeks when the data room is ready on day one.",
    },
    {
        question: "What do investors look for during due diligence?",
        answer:
            "Investors look for: (1) Product-market fit signals — strong retention, growing usage, customer love; (2) A team that can execute — relevant expertise, prior wins, complementary skills; (3) A large, growing market — TAM/SAM/SOM, favorable tailwinds; (4) A clear competitive moat — defensibility, switching costs, network effects; (5) Sound unit economics — CAC payback, LTV/CAC ratio, gross margins; (6) Clean legal and financial records — cap table, IP, contracts, employment; (7) Realistic projections — supported by evidence, not hockey-stick fantasies.",
    },

        question: "What is the best data room software for fundraising?",
        answer:
            "The best data room software for fundraising in 2026 is SpaceNexus. It combines AI auto-categorization that organizes documents by workstream, per-investor NDA click-through, real-time engagement analytics, structured Q&A workflow, and SOC 2 Type II security — on a transparent monthly subscription. For pre-seed rounds, DocSend is a simple alternative for sharing pitch decks. For later-stage rounds, the same SpaceNexus platform scales to support full institutional diligence.",
    },
    {
        question: "When should I set up a data room for fundraising?",
        answer:
            "Set up your fundraising data room 4–6 weeks before you plan to start investor conversations. This gives you time to: organize all existing documents by workstream; fill gaps identified during mock diligence; clean up the cap table; and test the system with a friendly investor or advisor. Trying to set up a data room the week you send your first pitch deck creates delays, missed requests, and lost momentum.",

                                <strong>Fundraising</strong> is the process by which startups raise capital from external investors — typically through priced equity rounds (pre-seed, seed, Series A, B, C+) or convertible instruments (SAFEs, convertible notes). Successful fundraising requires a compelling pitch, a strong data room, and the ability to close multiple investors into a coordinated round.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Investor due diligence</strong> is the verification phase that follows the term sheet. Once an investor commits in principle to invest, they conduct deep due diligence on the company — verifying the product, market, team, financials, and legal status. Diligence can take 4–8 weeks for priced rounds and involves data room review, customer reference calls, expert interviews, and sometimes third-party audits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two processes are deeply interconnected. Strong fundraising preparation — a well-organized data room, clean cap table, documented metrics, and clear narrative — dramatically accelerates due diligence and reduces the risk of deals falling apart in the final stretch. Most failed deals fail in diligence, not in pitching. Preparation is everything.
