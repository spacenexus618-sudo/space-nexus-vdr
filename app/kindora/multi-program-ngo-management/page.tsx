  {
    question: "What is multi-program NGO management?",
    answer:
      "Multi-program NGO management is the practice of coordinating, tracking, and reporting across multiple programs within a single NGO from one unified platform. It replaces per-program silos with cross-program visibility, shared resource management, and consolidated reporting — giving leadership a complete view of organizational performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do NGOs need multi-program management software?",
    answer:
      "NGOs with multiple programs face challenges that single-program tools cannot solve: shared staff across programs, consolidated grant reporting, cross-program client referrals, and organizational-wide dashboards. Multi-program management software eliminates data silos and provides the coordination layer that multi-program operations require.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Kindora handle multiple programs?",
    answer:
      "Kindora supports unlimited programs with independent configuration — each program has its own enrollment forms, outcome metrics, workflows, and reporting templates. Cross-program features include shared dashboards, resource allocation, consolidated financials, and organization-wide analytics.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can staff work across multiple programs in Kindora?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora supports cross-program staff and volunteer assignment with time tracking, availability management, and workload visibility. Staff see all their assigned programs in one portal, and managers see utilization across programs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does multi-program management affect grant compliance?",
    answer:
      "Kindora tracks grant compliance requirements across programs — deadlines, reporting obligations, and spending limits. Consolidated compliance dashboards show the status of every grant across every program, with automated reminders for upcoming deadlines.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we compare performance across programs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora's analytics compare enrollment, attendance, outcomes, cost-per-participant, and other metrics across programs. Identify which programs are most effective, where resources are best deployed, and where improvements are needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to set up multi-program management?",
    answer:
      "Most organizations are running their first program within hours. Adding additional programs takes minutes — configure program-specific settings, and cross-program features (dashboards, financials, reporting) work automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Kindora suitable for small NGOs with 2–3 programs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora is designed for NGOs of every size — from small organizations with 2–3 programs to large NGOs with dozens. Multi-program features provide value at any scale by eliminating spreadsheet silos and enabling consolidated visibility.",

            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
              <p>
                Multi-program NGO management is the practice of coordinating, tracking, and reporting across multiple programs within a single NGO from one unified platform. It replaces per-program silos — where each program has its own spreadsheets, tools, and data — with cross-program visibility, shared resource management, and consolidated reporting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The category emerged from the challenges NGOs face as they scale. A 5-person NGO running one program can manage with spreadsheets. A 50-person NGO running 15 programs across 5 locations needs a coordination layer that spreadsheet tools cannot provide. Multi-program management software provides that layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, multi-program management is a strategic capability for NGOs that need to scale impact without proportional administrative growth. Effective implementations reduce duplicated effort, improve resource utilization, enable cross-program referrals, and give leadership the consolidated visibility needed for strategic decision-making.
