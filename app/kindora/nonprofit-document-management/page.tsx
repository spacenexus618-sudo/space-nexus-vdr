    question: "What is nonprofit document management software?",
    answer:
      "Nonprofit document management software is a platform that organizes, stores, and secures all nonprofit documents — from grant files and board minutes to policies and compliance records. It replaces scattered email attachments, shared drives, and filing cabinets with a centralized, searchable, and audit-ready document library purpose-built for nonprofit operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does document version control work in Kindora?",
    answer:
      "Every time a document is edited, Kindora creates a new version while preserving the full history. You can view who changed what, when, and why. If a mistake is made, restoring any previous version takes a single click — ensuring no critical nonprofit document is ever lost or overwritten.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we control who sees specific documents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora provides granular role-based access controls. You can restrict document access by role, department, grant, or individual user. Board members see board materials, finance staff see financial records, and external auditors get read-only access to only the documents they need to review.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does document management help with grant compliance?",
    answer:
      "Kindora maintains tamper-evident audit trails for every document access, edit, and share. Automated retention policies ensure grant documents are archived according to funder requirements. One-click audit reports compile all relevant documentation — making grant audits straightforward and stress-free.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to set up document management?",
    answer:
      "Most nonprofits are running their document management system within 24 hours. Pre-built folder templates for grants, board materials, and financial records accelerate setup. Bulk document import with AI auto-categorization handles legacy files. More complex implementations with custom taxonomies and integrations typically take 1–2 weeks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we migrate from Google Drive or Dropbox?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora provides guided migration tools that preserve folder structures, metadata, and version history when moving from Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or network file shares. Bulk import with AI auto-categorization handles thousands of documents efficiently.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does document management integrate with other Kindora features?",
    answer:
      "Document management is fully integrated with Kindora's workflow automation, grant management, and reporting features. Grant applications automatically organize related documents. Workflow approvals link to the relevant documents. Reporting pulls data from document metadata for compliance reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "What security certifications does Kindora have?",
    answer:
      "Kindora is SOC 2 Type II certified with AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit. The platform undergoes annual third-party security audits and maintains compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and major funder security requirements. Tamper-evident audit logs provide complete document access history.",

              <p>
                Nonprofit document management is the practice of storing, organizing, securing, and retrieving nonprofit documents across grants, programs, departments, and time. It combines centralized document storage with version control, access management, compliance tracking, and search capabilities — all purpose-built for the unique needs of nonprofit organizations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The category emerged from the limitations of shared drives, email attachments, and filing cabinets for nonprofit operations. Traditional approaches scattered documents across inboxes, personal drives, and physical filing systems — making retrieval slow, version control impossible, and compliance audits painful. Modern nonprofit document management is strategic — it spans the full document lifecycle from capture through collaboration, storage, retrieval, sharing, and retention.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, document management is a core capability for nonprofits that need to scale operations while maintaining compliance. Effective implementations reduce document retrieval time, prevent version conflicts, enhance team collaboration, and ensure audit readiness for funders, boards, and regulators.
