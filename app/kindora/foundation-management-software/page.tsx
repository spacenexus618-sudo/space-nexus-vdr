  {
    question: "What is foundation management software?",
    answer:
      "Foundation management software is a platform that helps foundations and philanthropic organizations manage the full grant lifecycle — from solicitation and application through award, disbursement, reporting, and renewal. It includes fund accounting, grantee management, impact measurement, compliance tracking, and board reporting — all purpose-built for foundation operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does foundation management software differ from grant management?",
    answer:
      "Grant management software typically focuses on the grantor's perspective — managing applications, reviews, and awards. Foundation management software is broader — it includes fund accounting, donor contribution tracking, investment management, board reporting, and multi-year strategic planning that foundations require.",
  },
  {
    question: "What features should foundation management software have?",
    answer:
      "Essential features include grant lifecycle management, fund accounting with restricted/unrestricted tracking, grantee management, impact measurement, compliance tracking, automated workflows, board reporting, and donor contribution management. Integration with accounting and program delivery systems is also important.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Kindora help with foundation management?",
    answer:
      "Kindora provides a complete foundation management platform with grant lifecycle tracking, fund accounting, grantee management, impact measurement, and automated compliance. The platform connects grant management with program delivery and financial reporting — giving foundations complete operational visibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Kindora manage multiple fund types?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora supports restricted funds, unrestricted funds, endowment funds, donor-advised funds, and matching funds. Each fund type has its own balance, spending rules, and reporting requirements — all tracked accurately with proper fund accounting.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does foundation management software handle compliance?",
    answer:
      "Kindora tracks compliance requirements for every grant — reporting deadlines, spending limits, and funder-specific obligations. Automated reminders alert staff before deadlines. Tamper-evident audit trails log every grant action, and one-click report generation compiles compliance documentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can foundation management software generate board reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kindora generates board-ready reports showing grant portfolio performance, financial summaries, impact outcomes, and compliance status. Reports can be customized by committee — finance, grants, programs — and exported in standard formats for board meetings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to implement foundation management software?",
    answer:
      "Most foundations are running their first grant within days. Pre-built grant templates, fund accounting setup, and grantee import tools accelerate implementation. More complex implementations with custom workflows and integrations typically take 2–4 weeks.",

              <p>
                Foundation management software is a platform that helps foundations and philanthropic organizations manage the full grant lifecycle — from solicitation and application through award, disbursement, reporting, and renewal. It combines fund accounting, grantee management, impact measurement, compliance tracking, and board reporting into one purpose-built system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The category emerged from the limitations of generic grant management tools for foundation operations. Foundations have unique needs — fund accounting for restricted and unrestricted funds, multi-year grant commitments, donor contribution tracking, investment management, and board oversight — that generic tools do not address.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, foundation management software is a strategic capability for foundations that need to maximize philanthropic impact while maintaining rigorous compliance. Effective implementations reduce administrative overhead, improve grantee relationships, ensure compliance, and provide the data foundation needs for strategic grantmaking decisions.
