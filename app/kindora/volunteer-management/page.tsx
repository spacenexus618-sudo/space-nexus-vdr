            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Volunteers are essential to many nonprofit operations, but managing them effectively requires more than a spreadsheet. Scheduling conflicts, untracked hours, poor communication, and volunteer burnout are common challenges when organizations lack dedicated volunteer management tools.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Kindora centralizes every aspect of volunteer management: recruitment and onboarding, scheduling and shift management, hour tracking, communication, and impact reporting. Volunteers get a self-service portal where they can manage their own participation, while your team gets real-time visibility into volunteer engagement across all programs.

                <p className="text-gray-600">Kindora allows you to create shift schedules, post open opportunities, and let volunteers sign up for available slots. Automated reminders reduce no-shows, and the dashboard gives you a real-time view of scheduled vs. filled positions across all programs.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can volunteers log their own hours?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600">Yes. Through the volunteer portal, volunteers can clock in and out, log hours for completed shifts, and view their participation history. Staff can also enter or adjust hours on behalf of volunteers as needed.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How does volunteer hour tracking support grant reporting?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600">Volunteer hours are tracked against specific programs and grants, so you can report the value of volunteer contributions to funders. Kindora can apply standard valuation rates to calculate the dollar equivalent of volunteer time for impact reports.</p>
