            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Nonprofit financial management is fundamentally different from for-profit accounting. Nonprofits must track funds by restricted and unrestricted categories, allocate costs across programs and grants, and produce financial reports that meet both GAAP and grantor requirements.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Kindora is built for these requirements from the ground up. Budget management, expense tracking, cost allocation, and financial reporting are integrated with your program and grant data, so financial reports always reflect the full picture of your nonprofit's operations.
            </p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How is nonprofit financial management different from regular accounting?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600">Nonprofits use fund accounting to track restricted vs. unrestricted funds, must allocate costs across programs for grant reporting, and need to demonstrate fiscal compliance to funders and board members. Kindora is built specifically for these requirements rather than adapting for-profit accounting software.</p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can Kindora generate audit-ready financial statements?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600">Yes. Kindora generates statement of activities, statement of financial position, cash flow statements, and functional expense allocations that meet GAAP and audit requirements. All transactions maintain a complete audit trail with supporting documentation.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Does Kindora integrate with QuickBooks or other accounting tools?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600">Kindora includes API access for integration with accounting platforms. The platform also serves as a complete financial management solution, reducing the need for separate accounting software by handling fund accounting, cost allocation, and financial reporting natively.</p>
