                Most nonprofits spend hours every week manually compiling grant
                reports — copying data from spreadsheets, reformatting tables,
                and chasing down program staff for outcome data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Purpose-built <strong>grant reporting software</strong> replaces
                this manual process with automated data pulling, pre-built
                templates, and one-click report generation — so your team can
                focus on delivering programs, not compiling reports.
