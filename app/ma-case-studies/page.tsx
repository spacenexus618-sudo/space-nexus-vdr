            "SpaceNexus was configured with a master deal room containing portfolio-wide documents, plus sub-rooms — one per property. AI auto-categorization organized documents by property.

        question: "What are M&A case studies?",
        answer:
            "M&A case studies are detailed real-world examples of mergers and acquisitions transactions, including the challenges faced, the solutions deployed, and the measurable results achieved. They serve as benchmarks for deal teams, advisors, and legal counsel who want to learn from how other transactions were managed — particularly around data room setup, due diligence workflows, Q&A management, and closing timelines.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical M&A diligence process take?",
        answer:
            "The diligence process for a typical mid-market M&A transaction takes 6–14 weeks. Pre-seed and seed rounds take 2–4 weeks. Series A and beyond take 4–8 weeks. Large-cap and cross-border transactions take 8–16 weeks. Modern data room platforms with AI redaction, structured Q&A, and real-time engagement analytics can compress these timelines by 30–50% compared to legacy VDRs.",
    },
    {
        question: "What role does a data room play in M&A transactions?",
        answer:
            "A data room (virtual data room or VDR) is the secure online platform where all transaction documents are stored, organized, and shared between buyers, sellers, and their counsel. Modern M&A data rooms support NDA click-through, AI redaction, structured Q&A, real-time engagement analytics, ethical wall enforcement, and tamper-evident audit trails. The data room is the operational backbone of the diligence process — without it, M&A transactions cannot move at the speed modern deal teams require.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the biggest challenges in M&A diligence?",
        answer:
            "The biggest challenges in M&A diligence are: (1) organizing thousands of documents across multiple workstreams; (2) enforcing ethical walls between competing bidders; (3) routing Q&A to the right subject matter experts; (4) tracking which buyers are most engaged; (5) maintaining regulatory compliance across jurisdictions; (6) compressing the diligence timeline without missing red flags; and (7) keeping the data room updated as new information becomes available. Modern data room platforms with AI capabilities dramatically reduce these challenges.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do deal teams choose a data room for M&A?",
        answer:
            "Deal teams choose an M&A Data Room based on: (1) speed of setup (under 24 hours is the modern standard); (2) AI redaction and auto-categorization capabilities; (3) per-page fee transparency (avoiding legacy VDRs with opaque pricing); (4) structured Q&A workflow; (5) ethical wall enforcement; (6) real-time engagement analytics; (7) SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 security certifications; (8) integration with e-signature, calendaring, and other deal tools; and (9) quality of customer support during the deal.",
