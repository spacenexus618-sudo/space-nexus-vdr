        question: "What is a due diligence data room?",
        answer: "A due diligence data room (also called a virtual data room or VDR) is a secure, cloud-based repository used to store, organize, and share confidential business documents during a transaction — such as an M&A deal, fundraising round, IPO, or legal proceeding. Unlike general file-sharing tools, a due diligence data room provides mandatory NDA enforcement at room entry, document-level access permissions, a tamper-evident audit trail, structured Q&A for due diligence requests, dynamic watermarking, and compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) that the transaction process requires.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do you set up a data room for due diligence?",
        answer: "Setting up a data room for due diligence involves six steps: (1) Choose a purpose-built VDR provider — not Dropbox or SharePoint. (2) Build your folder structure by workstream (Legal, Financial, Commercial, HR, Technology, Operations). (3) Upload and organize documents — AI auto-categorization dramatically speeds this step. (4) Apply NDA and access permissions — configure which buyer groups can access which folders before inviting anyone. (5) Configure Q&A workflow — set up categories, assign owners, and establish response SLAs. (6) Invite buyer parties and monitor engagement analytics in real time.",
    },
    {
        question: "What documents go in a due diligence data room?",
        answer: "A due diligence data room should contain documents across six workstreams: Legal (incorporation documents, material contracts, litigation register, IP assignments), Financial (audited financials, management accounts, working capital analysis, tax returns), Commercial (customer list and contracts, pipeline data, competitive analysis), HR (org chart, executive employment agreements, equity plan, cap table), Technology (architecture overview, IP ownership documentation, SOC 2 certification, penetration test results), and Operations (facility leases, insurance policies, supplier contracts, environmental permits).",
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between a data room and a virtual data room?",
        answer: "The terms 'data room' and 'virtual data room' (VDR) are used interchangeably in modern practice. Historically, a data room referred to a physical room where confidential documents were reviewed in-person under supervision. Virtual data rooms replaced physical rooms in the early 2000s by delivering the same secure, controlled document access over the internet. Today, 'data room due diligence' always means a cloud-based virtual data room — physical data rooms are no longer used in practice.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long should a due diligence data room stay open?",
        answer: "A due diligence data room should stay open from the time it is launched (typically after signing an NDA or LOI) until closing — typically 4–8 weeks for mid-market M&A. After closing, access should be withdrawn from buyer parties and the room archived with a complete audit trail for the seller's records. Most VDR providers offer post-close archiving as part of the subscription.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can buyers download documents from a due diligence data room?",
        answer: "Download permissions in a due diligence data room are controlled by the seller. Most VDR platforms allow the sell-side administrator to enable or disable downloads at the folder, document, or user-group level. For sensitive documents (personal data, key customer contracts), download can be disabled while still allowing online viewing. For documents requiring offline review by advisors (audited financials, legal agreements), selective download can be granted. All access — including downloads — is logged in the tamper-evident audit trail.",
    },
    {
        question: "What security standards should a due diligence data room have?",
        answer: "A due diligence data room should meet the following minimum security standards: SOC 2 Type II certification (audited annually), AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 encryption in transit, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, role-based access control (RBAC) at the document level, dynamic watermarking on viewed documents, IP restriction by geography or address, a complete immutable audit trail, and — for deals with international parties — ISO 27001 certification. For transactions with US regulatory involvement, SEC/FINRA-ready compliance logging is also required.",

                            <p>
                                <strong className="text-gray-900">Data room due diligence</strong> refers to the process of conducting business transaction due diligence through a virtual data room (VDR) — a secure, cloud-based platform that replaces the physical "data room" model of the pre-internet era, where buyers reviewed documents in a supervised physical space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In modern M&A, fundraising, and legal transactions, a due diligence data room is the central hub where the seller (or company raising capital) uploads and organizes all confidential documents — financial statements, legal contracts, HR records, IP documentation — and grants buyers or investors controlled, monitored access under the terms of an NDA.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Done well, data room due diligence compresses timelines, reduces Q&A volume, and gives the sell-side team a negotiating advantage through real-time buyer engagement analytics. Done poorly — disorganized rooms, misrouted permissions, email-managed Q&A — it delays deals, inflates advisor costs, and signals risk to buyers.
                            </p>
                            <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-xl px-5 py-4 mt-6">
                                <p className="text-sm text-blue-800 font-medium">
                                    <strong>Key distinction:</strong> A due diligence data room is not a file-sharing tool. Dropbox, Google Drive, and SharePoint lack NDA enforcement, document-level permissions, tamper-evident audit trails, structured Q&A, and the compliance certifications that a transaction process requires. Using a general file-sharing tool for M&A due diligence creates legal, regulatory, and security exposure.
