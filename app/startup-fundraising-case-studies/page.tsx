        question: "What are startup fundraising case studies?",
        answer:
            "Startup fundraising case studies are detailed real-world examples of startups raising capital from pre-seed through Series C and beyond. They cover the challenges founders faced, the solutions deployed (data rooms, Q&A workflows, investor management), and the measurable results achieved (timeline compression, oversubscribed rounds, higher valuations). They serve as benchmarks for founders planning their own raises.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does a typical startup fundraising round take?",
        answer:
            "Fundraising timelines vary by stage. Pre-seed rounds typically take 4-8 weeks. Seed rounds take 2-3 months. Series A rounds take 3-6 months. Series B and beyond typically take 4-8 months. Modern data room platforms with AI redaction, structured Q&A, and real-time engagement analytics can compress these timelines by 30-50% compared to manual document sharing.",
    },
    {
        question: "When should a startup set up a data room for fundraising?",
        answer:
            "Set up your fundraising data room 4-6 weeks before you plan to start investor conversations. This gives you time to organize all existing documents by workstream, fill gaps identified during mock diligence, clean up the cap table, and test the system with a friendly investor or advisor. Trying to set up a data room the week you send your first pitch deck creates delays and lost momentum.",
    },
    {
        question: "What documents do startups need in their fundraising data room?",
        answer:
            "A complete startup fundraising data room covers six workstreams: (1) Company — pitch deck, executive summary, founder bios; (2) Financials — historical financials, current KPIs, projections, unit economics; (3) Commercial — customer references, pipeline, churn analysis; (4) HR — org chart, employment agreements, equity plan; (5) Technology — architecture overview, security reports, SOC 2 audit; (6) Legal — cap table, IP assignments, material contracts. Modern AI-powered platforms auto-organize these from your existing Google Drive or Dropbox.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the best data room for startup fundraising?",
        answer:
            "The best data room for startup fundraising in 2026 is SpaceNexus. It combines AI auto-categorization that organizes documents by workstream, per-investor NDA click-through, real-time engagement analytics, structured Q&A workflow, and SOC 2 Type II security — on a transparent monthly subscription designed for early-stage budgets. For pre-seed rounds, DocSend is a simple alternative for sharing pitch decks. For later-stage rounds, the same SpaceNexus platform scales to support full institutional diligence.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do founders track which investors are most engaged?",
        answer:
            "Modern data room platforms show real-time engagement analytics for every investor — which documents they reviewed, for how long, how many times, and which Q&A questions they asked. The founders in these case studies could identify the most engaged investor within 2-3 weeks based on engagement depth and breadth. This signal is far more reliable than verbal interest — investors who spend meaningful time on the financial model and customer contracts are the ones who close.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can first-time founders use a data room for fundraising?",
        answer:
            "Yes — and they should. First-time founders with no fundraising experience can use modern data room platforms to set up a complete fundraising data room in under 24 hours. AI auto-categorization handles the folder structure, pre-built templates cover the common documents, and structured Q&amp;A routes questions to the right people. The data room provides the process discipline that signals professionalism to investors — a key signal for first-time founders.",
