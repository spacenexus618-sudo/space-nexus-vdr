            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Nonprofits that use dedicated donor management software see higher retention rates, larger average gifts, and more efficient fundraising operations. Without a centralized system, donor data gets scattered across spreadsheets, email inboxes, and disconnected tools, making it impossible to build the kind of personalized relationships that drive long-term giving.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Kindora brings donor management, fundraising, and communication into one unified platform. Every interaction is logged, every gift is tracked, and every donor gets a complete profile that your team can access from anywhere.
