            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Grants are a critical revenue source for many nonprofits, but managing multiple grants with different reporting requirements, deadlines, and compliance rules is complex. Without dedicated grant management software, organizations risk missed deadlines, compliance violations, and lost funding opportunities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Kindora centralizes grant tracking, compliance monitoring, reporting, and budget management in one platform. Your team can see the status of every grant at a glance, automate routine reporting tasks, and maintain the audit trail needed for grantor reviews.
