    question: "Is Kindora a direct replacement for Instrumentl?",
    answer:
      "Not for every use case. Instrumentl specializes in grant research and discovery and also documents application and post-award workflows across its plans. Kindora is a broader nonprofit operations platform with donor, grant, client-program, and financial workflows. If grant prospect discovery is essential, verify that requirement before choosing Kindora as a replacement; some organizations may prefer to use both products.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Kindora include Instrumentl's grant discovery database?",
    answer:
      "Kindora's grant management feature documents grant tracking and lifecycle workflows, not a funder-discovery database equivalent to Instrumentl's. Organizations that rely on Instrumentl to research funding opportunities should retain a discovery tool or confirm their specific prospecting needs before switching.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Instrumentl offer?",
    answer:
      "Instrumentl's published pricing page presents Discover, Pre-Award, Full Lifecycle, and Enterprise plans. It describes grant research and application workflows, with features such as CRM sync, post-award spend tracking, and accounting integrations varying by plan. Check the current plan page for exact inclusions.",
  },
  {
    question: "When might Kindora be a better fit?",
    answer:
      "Kindora may fit nonprofits that want donor management, grant tracking, client-program workflows, and financial management in one broader platform. Compare the available features and plan details with your team's current systems and confirm required workflows with Kindora.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a nonprofit use Instrumentl and Kindora together?",
    answer:
      "Potentially. A nonprofit may use Instrumentl for grant research and discovery while using Kindora for broader donor, program, grant-record, and financial workflows. Confirm integration options and avoid duplicating data entry before adopting a two-product setup.",
