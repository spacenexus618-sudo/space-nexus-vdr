          body: "Small nonprofits often start with cash-basis accounting because it's simpler. But as grant portfolios grow, cash basis creates serious mismatches between when grant revenue is recognized and when expenses are incurred.\n\nAccrual accounting â€” recognizing revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash timing â€” gives a much more accurate picture of financial health and is required for audited financial statements. If you're still on cash basis and receiving more than $500K in grants, it's time to switch.",
