            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Nonprofits delivering direct services need to track who they serve, what services they receive, and what outcomes they achieve. Without dedicated case management software, organizations rely on paper files, spreadsheets, or multiple disconnected systems that make it difficult to measure impact, report to funders, or identify service gaps.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-3xl">
              Kindora provides a unified platform for client intake, service delivery tracking, outcome measurement, and program reporting. Whether you run one program or dozens, your team can manage caseloads, track progress, and generate impact reports from a single source of truth.
